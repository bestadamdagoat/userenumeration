# userenumeration
This repository is dedicated to bringing awareness to user enumeration techniques. Many companies do not take user enumeration seriously, which leads to white hats avoiding researching techniques related to user enumeration. User enumeration has been a common theme in many recent breaches and can be used in combination with other various techniques such as doxxing, brute-forcing, phishing, etc. Troy Hunt has a very good [article](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/) on this that's still relevant to this day. (even though it's **8** years old since writing this!) Anything that I publish here has to fit all the following criteria:
* Previously been reported
* Denied/marked as informal
* Ignored
